# CareConnect
Hospitals need efficient systems to manage patients, doctors, appointments, and treatments. Currently, many hospitals use manual registers or disconnected software, which makes it difficult to manage records, avoid scheduling conflicts, and track patient history.

CareConnect is a web application that allows Admins, Doctors, and Patients to interact with the system based on their roles.

These are the  frameworks that are used in project :
- Flask for application back-end
-  Jinja2 templating, HTML, CSS and Bootstraps for application front-end
-  SQLite for database
